<Obj name="XB01">
<Desc>Element 1 :
This formation of what seems to be totems is not natural
My guess was right, this planet was once populated..
I wonder what's the link between these totems and the artefact i got..
</Desc>

<Obj name="XB02">
<Desc>Element 2 :
Magic source detected.
Found some part and it seems that they used this as lamp. 		
They weren't that tribal after all, weren't they ?

<Obj name="XB03">
